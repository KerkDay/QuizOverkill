# Quiz Overkill
Y'all tired of personality quizzes with no personality? Well, I can't guarantee an end to that; but I can guarantee that Quiz Overkill has the capabilites to make incredibly complex quizzes.

This project is currently under construction. If you've found this, I'm sorry.

## What's this made with?
Glad you asked, hypothetical person!
Quiz Overkill is made using React, predominantly. This is a project that helped me learn exactly how ReactJS works.
It's also made using SnowPack, because [https://fireship.io/](Fireship.io) has been advocating hard for it to replace Webpack.

You can find more details about the other stuff included in the package.json file

## How can I contribute?
Oh gosh, I guess we can collab on this.
First, I hope you know what a pull request is before you start, or I may not have confidence in your abilities contributing.
- Please, make your commit message **Descriptive**!
- Document your code so I don't have to think too hard about what you've done. If possible give me a diagram of what you've done, or a screenshot.
- Don't go off topic! Don't include jokes! I'm the funny one here, not you!

To get this thingy working, just `npm update` after you pull.
`npm run start` will get a local server running so you can play around.
